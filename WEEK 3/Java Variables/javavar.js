// Variables

// How can we create variables?
//  = means assignment
// this whole line underneath is a variable declaration

const firstName = "Natalie";
const lastName = "Lovibond Hodgson";
console.log("Fullname", firstName + " " + lastName);
// console.log(typeof firstName) = string

// How can we change variables?

// What is the difference between const and let?
// const stands for constant
// let allows us to change the value over time or reassign the value over time
// consider const immutable / not reassignable
// let is mutable and reassignable
// age below is an identifier

let age = 27;

// Why we don't use var...
